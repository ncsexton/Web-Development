			<p>
				My name is Nathan Sexton, and I'm from Tri-Cities TN, where I lived until moving to Cookeville for university. I love arcade fighting games, and have played and competed in fighting game tournaments
				 for about six years. I have attended tournaments in nine different states, and will likely add to that list later this year. I also love to cook, with my most experienced type of recipes being pastas,
				 of which I have made countless different kinds. My favorite food to cook is shephards pie, as my family all love it and I have made it enough times to know the recipe by memory.
