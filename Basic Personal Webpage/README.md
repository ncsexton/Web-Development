# Basic Personal Webpage

Personal page I created to showcase some of my early undergraduate research experiments I completed over the summer. For an easy-to-view preview of an outdated version, I included the about.html page in the directory that you can view without needing to use the .phtml files for the most recent version. This version is before I added any PHP or Javascript to my website, so it is purely to give an idea of what the site looks like without using the PHP code.
